## TODAY I LEARNED 

09-27-21

Today we will start class on subqueries. 
Until last week I have learned basic statements in SQL such as SELECT, FROM DISTINCT and using clauses such as where, order by, group by, limit 
Functions such as date and time (CURDATE(), NOW(), CURTIME(), Numerical functions such as (AVG, MIN, MAX.. etc)

- Today we learned about JOIN. There are different types of join such as Inner join, right join, left join, full join etc. 
Join helps us to join 2 or more table where they have common items in one or many different tables. 

SYNTAX for joining is as below; 

Lets say we have 3 different table as table name as follows 
 Employee, Manager, and Departments 
Employee tables has following rows such as .. emp_no, name, DOB, date_hire etc 
Manager table has following rows such as ... emp_no, dep_no 
Departments has following table such as .... dep_no, dep_name 


FIND what is common then JOIN 


09-20-21: Today we learned how to appropriately use Aggregate functions like GROUP BY and adding conditions to GROUP BY with HAVING . 

09-20-20: I we learned few things in SQL, they are Where command, Order By and Limit 



09-21-20: 

I learned about functions such as CONCAT, LIKE / NOT LIKE/ SUBSTR ( these are important top create username and further break down months, and so on).   

Try to think of your results as batches, sets, or pages. The first five results are your first page. The five after that would be your second page, etc. Update the query to find the tenth page of results.

LIMIT and OFFSET can be used to create multiple pages of data. What is the relationship between OFFSET (number of results to skip), LIMIT (number of results per page), and the page number?

SELECT  first_name, last_name, emp_no
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date LIKE '199%' 
AND birth_date LIKE '%-12-25'
ORDER BY hire_date
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 45;

###    GIT Clone 

1. Make a new repository on github called "now_i_know" or "my_data_science_notes"
- copy the SSH clone address
2. `cd ~/codeup-data-science` 
3. Clone your new repo with git git 
`git clone ` then paste that git clone address
4. `cd now_i_know` and do:
	- `git status` to double check that this is a repo
	- `git remote -v` to show the remotes
5. Move your `today_i_learned.txt` document that you made earlier this morning (or right now..)
6. `git add` the new file
7. `git commit` this new work
8. `git push` to push this work
- Oh btw: if you ever get a message about "there's no remote setup" and then the message gives you the code to push and set up the remote, copy + paste that code snippet
